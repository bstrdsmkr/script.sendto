SendTo

Right now this addon is in development - don't expect it to do anything

Goal: 

With many homes having multiple XBMC setups, it would be nice to have a way for them to be a little more "aware" of each other. This addon provides for some very basic "send to" type functionality. When watching a video or playing music on one XBMC instance you can use this addon to send the video to another XBMC instance for playback to continue. This is not an airplay-like solution as it actually stops the video on one instance and starts it on another, no streaming from the parent device.
